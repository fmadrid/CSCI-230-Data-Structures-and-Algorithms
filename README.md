# CSCI-230-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
CSCI230 Data Structure and Algorithms is a "first"-course in data structures and algorithms at [Crafton Hills College](https://www.craftonhills.edu) where students both implement and analyze foundational data structures and algorithms with the Java programming language.

This repository contains any source code used during lecture, solutions for lab and homework assignments, and textbook examples.
